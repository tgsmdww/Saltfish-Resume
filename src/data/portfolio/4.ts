    "An Intelligent Box Based on Bot and voice UI to Support the Retired People's Group Therapeutic Session",
  title1: "ABSTRACT",
  content1:
    "Retired older adults reported having lower levels of purpose, mastery, and growth mainly due to the lack of social interaction. To solve this issue, they tend to join a social network like an older adult’s support group; However, they can still face the same challenge due to the lack of deeper connections within the group. The feeling of disconnection and isolation can lead to mental disorders. We present WeCare, a foldable four screens voice user interface (VUI) tool that supports retired elder's mental wellness through collaborative storytelling. During the process, older adults engage in a metaphorical way of revisiting, reflecting and reinterpreting their life experience by collaboratively making up a story based on a picture provided by the device. WeCare promotes bonding within a small group, helps older adults to be heard and feel the sense of connection and empowerment.",

    question: "How do you evaluate the effects of your product?",
    answer:
      "We conducted a user evaluation among four target users. Indeed, it is hard to evaluate the improvement in the users' mental wellness, but we could tell from the users' will to participant in the same process again that it's helpful."
  },
  {
    question:
      "It seems to work on everyone not only the retired? Why do you choose the retired community",
    answer:
      "At the beginning, we focus on the retired community and then we found that our initial design was more ubiquitous. Yes, it could be used by other groups that could use therapeutic storytelling like children."
