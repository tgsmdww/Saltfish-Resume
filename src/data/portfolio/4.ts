    "Retired seniors have hard time in social life. Our survey found out that a majority of seniors have positive retirement life is due to a good support group; And the one who have issue with retirement life had trouble finding a support group or simply people to talk to. We also identified there are people who are currently in a support group have issue with there retirement life; Through the semi-structured interview, we found out there’s mixed experience toward a support group session. We believe that there are opportunities in designing a better experience for a support session among retired seniors. In this paper, we proposed the design of an intelligent tool which enhance storytelling experience to support retired elders mental wellness: A box that has multiple screens to support circled group and controlled by voice UI. It could generate storytelling on therapeutic topics through machine learning, ask right questions, generate calming music and set timer to support the group session. We tested it through some groups of retired people and received positive feedbacks.",

  //   answer:
  //     "Yes. Currently, people use tying-based method like Markdown and LaTeX's mathematics mode, or selection-based method of choosing from a series of characters, to input special characters. Our method is significantly better in efficiency. Details can be seen inside the paper."
