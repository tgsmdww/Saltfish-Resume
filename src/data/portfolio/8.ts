    "We tried to solve the problem of interactions to large display walls being limited to keyboards and mice; we developed an interactive system for users to interact with the wall display by using smartphones and head-mounted devices as controllers and navigators. The system was controlled by computer vision algorithms to coordinate entities on the screen, and the devices were navigated by optical tracking systems. Towards the end, we also evaluated their performance, efficiency, and the possibility of their collaboration given the nature of the devicesâ€™ difference.",
